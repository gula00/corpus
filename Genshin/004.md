the word on the street

I apologize for the short notice, but it was an emergency.

run some errands

Fate is an immutable force. I can but lament as the inevitable unfolds.

You can’t have the wisdom beyond the reach of your fellow man without attracting his fear and suspicion.

Can I get a stand ovation?

fill me on the deets

fend for yourself

throw you under the bus

you think I am one to fold so easily
