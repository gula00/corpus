Charlotte

A reporter for The Streambird, a renowned newspaper in Fontaine. Charlotte has an enthusuastic nature and a keen sense of news. Traveling across the streets of Fontaine, she captures the "truth" of a multitude of matters with her trusty Kamera.

Her lifelong endeavor is to publish authentic and breaking exclusive scoops. In her pursuit of the "truth", she is willing to go beyond the norm, even at the risk of her own safety. She is also well aware of the storms that will be triggered upon the revelation of "truth".

But despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever phased Charlotte in the slightest.

Most of time, you are hard to pin down.

We don't really have much going on right now, so we're all yours!

Please don't be too hard on her.

Not only would the book itself be confiscated, but she'd be looking at a whole day in solitary confinement, at the very least.

After all that hard work, I think I've earned myself a nice cup of tea.

Aw, man. Paimon was so ready to knock this out in one go ...
