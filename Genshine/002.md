Charlotte

A reporter for The Streambird, a renowned newspaper in Fontaine. Charlotte has an enthusuastic nature and a keen sense of news. Traveling across the streets of Fontaine, she captures the "truth" of a multitude of matters with her trusty Kamera.

Her lifelong endeavor is to publish authentic and breaking exclusive scoops. In her pursuit of the "truth", she is willing to go beyond the norm, even at the risk of her own safety. She is also well aware of the storms that will be triggered upon the revelation of "truth".

But despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever phased Charlotte in the slightest.
